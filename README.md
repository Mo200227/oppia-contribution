## Why I Chose This Issue

I chose this issue because it involves Python backend work which aligns with my programming experience. The task is well-scoped and clearly defined: add a `developer_notes` field to the feature flag specification in the Oppia codebase and display it in the Release Coordinator UI when non-empty.

The issue has detailed comments from previous contributors showing exactly which files need to change, giving me a clear roadmap for navigating an unfamiliar codebase. A maintainer (NITISH084) personally confirmed the issue is still available and open for contribution.

## Understanding the Issue

### Problem Description
The Oppia platform has feature flags that developers can toggle on/off in the Release Coordinator page. Currently there is no way for developers to leave notes for admins explaining what a flag does or what steps to take when toggling it.

### Expected Behavior
Each feature flag should have an optional `developer_notes` field hardcoded by developers in the backend. When non-empty, it should display in the Release Coordinator UI.

### Current Behavior
Feature flags have no notes field. Admins have no way to know if special steps are required when toggling a flag.

### Affected Components
- `core/domain/feature_flag_domain.py`
- `core/templates/pages/release-coordinator-page/features-tab/features-tab.component.html`
- `core/templates/pages/release-coordinator-page/features-tab/features-tab.component.ts`
